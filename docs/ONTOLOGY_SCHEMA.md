# QuantFlow ontology schema — v0.2

> **FROZEN 2026-07-18 as `experimental` (WO-002); amended to v0.2 same day (WO-002b: state machines — transition tables, command/event split, fork boundary).** All types below carry lifecycle `experimental`: they may be refined by work order during the codegen era, but drift without an order is a defect. Promotion to `active` closes a type for modification (extension via links/kinds only) and happens by the `promote_type` action, per order.
> Scope: **research-only v1** (no order execution), **sports betting first** (Bovada: UFC, tennis, football), with a market-agnostic core so other markets later arrive as new `kind` values — never as clone types.

**Design laws applied:** domain first, data last · one canonical type per real thing · lifecycle `experimental → active`, closed for modification once active · every object/property/action described, because agents reason over this schema.

## Storage split (Kitchen Sink defense)

The Kernel holds **identity and lineage** — things with names that link to other things. Bulk time-series (odds ticks, feature matrices) live in **content-hashed Parquet files queried via DuckDB**; the Kernel holds the *pointer objects* (Dataset, OddsSeries) with hashes. An odds quote is a data row, not a Kernel object.

---

## Objects — Domain plane (what the research is about)

### `competitor`
A participant that can be bet on: fighter, player, or team.
- `kind` — `ufc_fighter | tennis_player | team` (extensible enum; a team's sport comes from its events)
- `name` — canonical display name; aliases handled via `alias_of` self-link to keep one identity per real competitor
- `external_refs` — source-system IDs (Bovada participant id, dataset keys) for entity resolution

### `event`
A scheduled real-world contest: a UFC bout, a tennis match, a football game.
- `sport` — `ufc | tennis | football` (extensible)
- `starts_at` — scheduled start (UTC); the **point-in-time fence**: no data timestamped after `starts_at` may inform a pre-event decision (Critic enforces)
- `status` — `scheduled | live | settled | void`
- `competition` — free-text tournament/league context (UFC 320, Wimbledon R16, NFL Week 3)

### `market`
One bettable proposition offered on an Event. **One canonical type** — moneyline, spread, total, and props are `kind` values with `params`, never separate types.
- `kind` — `moneyline | spread | total | prop`
- `params` — kind-specific structure. **Props are first-class, not a stringly-typed corner** (the founder's edge lives here): `prop_category` vocabulary per sport — UFC: `method (ko_tko | submission | decision) | round | round_group | itd | fighter_method combo`; tennis: `set_betting | total_games | handicap`; football: player/team props typed as adopted. Untyped props may exist only as `experimental`.
- `sides` — the named outcomes offered (e.g. `["Jones", "Miocic"]`, `["over", "under"]`)
- `correlation_group` — markets on the same Event sharing outcome dependence (fighter ML ⟷ fighter-by-KO) carry a shared group key; parlay evaluation and the Critic's correlation checks traverse this

### `odds_series`
The recorded price history of one Market at one book. Pointer object: `data_ref` → hashed Parquet segment(s) of timestamped quotes.
- `book` — `bovada | pinnacle | ...` — Pinnacle series serve as the sharp CLV benchmark
- `data_ref` — content hash + path of the Parquet data
- `coverage` — first/last captured timestamps, quote count (so agents can judge sufficiency without opening the file)

### `result`
The settled truth of an Event and the grading of its Markets.
- `outcome` — structured result (winner, score/method, per-market grading `win | loss | push | void`)
- `settled_at` — when truth became known; also point-in-time fenced

---

## Objects — Research plane (the scientific machine)

### `hypothesis`
A falsifiable research claim; the root of every lineage chain. Kills "untracked ideas."
- `claim` — the statement under test ("same-event UFC method props are priced near-independently, leaving +EV correlated parlays")
- `success_criteria` — what evaluation outcome would support it (e.g. per-leg CLV > 0 at n ≥ 200, risk_of_ruin < 5%, OOS-consistent)
- `sources` — citations grounding the claim (arXiv IDs, papers, articles); Researcher agents cite what they build on, and lineage extends *outside* the system
- `status` — `open | supported | rejected | inconclusive` (only an Evaluation-backed action may set the last three)

### `strategy`
A versioned, parameterized betting rule set under test.
- `spec_ref` — Artifact link to the code/rules that define it (the Strategy object is identity; the Artifact is content)
- `version` — monotonic; new versions are new objects `DERIVED_FROM` the old (extend, don't mutate)
- `stake_model` — `flat | fractional_kelly | custom` — how positions are sized in backtests

### `ticket`
**The atomic unit of the founder's betting style.** A proposed wager: one leg or a parlay of legs. Strategies emit Tickets; backtests grade them; Evaluations aggregate them. One canonical type — a single bet is a one-leg Ticket, never a separate object.
- `kind` — `single | parlay`
- `legs` — structured list: each leg = Market ref + side + price-at-selection (american/decimal) + captured_at (point-in-time fenced: the price must have been *available* then — the Critic's line-availability check)
- `combined_price` — the parlay's total odds as offered/computed
- `stake` — simulated stake under the Strategy's stake model
- `correlation_note` — declared dependence structure among legs (same-event legs must reference their `correlation_group`s); naive independence-multiplied pricing vs correlation-aware fair value is exactly where mispricing hunting happens
- `grade` — `pending | win | loss | push | void` + per-leg grades once Results settle

### `dataset`
A versioned, content-hashed, point-in-time-correct data snapshot. Kills "garbage in."
- `kind` — `odds_history | results | features | mixed`
- `content_hash` — hash over the underlying Parquet set; identical hash = identical data, byte-for-byte
- `as_of` — the point-in-time boundary this dataset respects
- `coverage` — sports, date range, event count (agent-readable sufficiency summary)

### `run`
**One canonical execution type.** An ingestion pull, a feature build, a backtest, and an analysis are `kind` values — never `BacktestRun`/`ScraperRun` clones (Silo defense).
- `kind` — `ingestion | feature_build | backtest | analysis`
- `status` — `queued | running | succeeded | failed | cancelled`
- `params` — full invocation parameters (reproducibility contract)
- `trace_id` — root of this run's span tree in L5

### `artifact`
An immutable, content-addressed published output. Kills "can't reproduce it." Reports are artifacts, not a separate type.
- `kind` — `strategy_spec | code | result_set | report | trajectory`
- `content_hash` / `storage_ref` — hash + durable location (exported **before** any sandbox dies)

### `evaluation`
A structured verdict on an Artifact/Run against a Hypothesis. Kills "it worked once." Metrics are parlay-aware: longshot styles have low hit rates and spiky ROI by design, so the honest lens is per-leg edge + simulated bankroll survival, not raw win percentage.
- `metrics` — typed metric set:
  - per-leg: `clv_avg` (vs sharp close — the north star), `leg_hit_rate`, `price_beat_rate`
  - per-ticket: `roi`, `hit_rate`, `avg_combined_price`, `sample_size`
  - **bankroll simulation (v1):** Monte Carlo over the graded ticket population — `risk_of_ruin`, `expected_max_drawdown`, `longest_expected_losing_streak`, `p5/p50/p95 bankroll trajectories`, `kelly_growth`. For a longshot-parlay style this is the difference between "proven system" and "survivorship story."
  - `oos_consistency` — out-of-sample agreement across time splits
- `critic_findings_ref` — link to the triaged Critic artifact weighed in this verdict
- `verdict` — `supports | rejects | inconclusive` + confidence + rationale text

## Objects — Operations plane (quant-agnostic)

`workspace` (one canvas of work) · `agent_definition` (a spawnable species: Researcher, Ingestion-Collector, Backtester, Critic) · `agent_session` (one durable live instance; L1 ledger identity) · `task` (a unit of assigned work) · `tool` (a capability exposed via MCP; generated from this schema) · `execution_environment` (`local_process | local_python | cloudflare_sandbox`) · `connection` (a typed cable between tiles).

Properties drafted at codegen time under the same laws (see ROADMAP WO-003/WO-005).

---

## Links (all traversable by agents; that's why they're links, not properties)

| Link | From → To | Serves |
|---|---|---|
| `participates_in` | competitor → event | roster/matchup traversal |
| `offered_on` | market → event | market discovery per event |
| `quotes` | odds_series → market | price history lookup |
| `settles` | result → event | truth attachment |
| `tests` | run/strategy → hypothesis | why does this run exist |
| `has_leg` | ticket → market | which tickets touch this market; correlation traversal |
| `uses` | run → dataset/strategy/tool | full input manifest |
| `executes_in` | run → execution_environment | where computation happened |
| `produces` | run/agent_session → dataset/artifact | output provenance (ingestion included) |
| `derived_from` | dataset/artifact/strategy → same | version & transformation lineage |
| `evaluated_by` | artifact/run → evaluation | verdict attachment |
| `assigned_to` / `delegates_to` | task → agent_session / session → session | work routing on canvas |

## Actions (initial command surface — MCP tools generate from these)

`create_hypothesis` · `register_dataset_version` · `start_run` / `complete_run` / `fail_run` / `cancel_run` / `retry_run` / `close_run` · `start_event` / `settle_event` / `void_event` · `grade_ticket` · `start_agent_session` / `block_agent_session` / `unblock_agent_session` / `cancel_agent_session` / `fail_agent_session` / `close_agent_session` · `publish_artifact` · `record_evaluation` · `resolve_hypothesis` (Evaluation-gated) · `request_approval` / `approve` / `deny` (pending-context-item gate, L2) · `promote_type` (`experimental → active`, schema governance itself as an action)

> **Reconciled with code 2026-07-18 (WO-005).** This list previously held 13 actions while `qf-kernel-schema/src/schema.ts` held 25. WO-005's derive-and-lint deliverable requires **every legal transition to have a command and every command to be a real schema action** — unsatisfiable with 13 actions against 24 legal transitions, so the transition verbs above were added in code. That contradiction was an order defect (the same order called this doc authoritative and unmodifiable); the doc is corrected here by the architect rather than reworked onto the builder.
>
> **`close_run` is deprecated pending removal.** WO-005's recommendation, accepted: `run`'s terminals are already `succeeded | failed | cancelled`, so a `closed` state would invent a second terminal and fight Law F, and a no-status-change ack does not belong beside rejectable transition actions. Removal from code lands by order — it is not a builder edit.

---

## State machines (v0.2 amendment)

**Every stateful type carries a legal-transition table, not a flat enum.** The Kernel must answer: *what state is this in, and what transitions are legal from here?* Illegal transitions are rejected at the command layer. The tables live beside the Zod types and **generate the conformance tests** — for every state, every illegal transition gets an auto-generated rejection test (lands via WO-003).

```
run:            queued → running → (succeeded | failed | cancelled); terminal → ∅
hypothesis:     open → (supported | rejected | inconclusive), only via record_evaluation-backed action; resolved → ∅
ticket:         pending → (win | loss | push | void), only via result settlement; graded → ∅
event:          scheduled → live → settled; scheduled → void; settled/void → ∅
agent_session:  starting → running ⇄ blocked; running|blocked → (cancelled | failed) → closed; running → closed; closed → ∅
dataset / artifact / strategy: immutable once registered — new versions are new objects via DERIVED_FROM (no machine needed)
```

**Command vs event — the split that makes the ledger real.** A **command** is an intent that can be *rejected* (`start_run`, `submit_ticket`). An **event** is a fact that already happened and can be *replayed* (`run.started`, `ticket.graded`). Flow: command in → validate against transition table → emit event → commit → project. Actors **report** state; the Kernel **decides** it. **There is no separate Receipt type — the append-only event log is the receipt log.** A parallel receipt object would be a duplicate-truth Silo.

**Two-level boundary (Law F, `docs/BLUEPRINT.md`).** The Kernel models *operational* states only (`run: queued → running`). Actor-internal states (`THINKING → TOOL_CALLING → WAITING`) are the runtime's private business, visible only as L5 trace spans — never as ontology types.

**Fork boundary.** Actor state is forkable **up to the first side effect**. Ingestion runs (external fetches) and artifact publication are hard boundaries forking never crosses — an API call cannot be un-sent. Research-only v1 keeps the side-effect surface small, which is what makes forked counterfactual trajectories (the RL-v2 substrate) viable.

**Distilled-artifact obligation (recall-layer seed).** `trajectory` and `report` artifacts are stored **distilled** (question / approach / resolution / systems touched) — never as raw transcripts — so the future recall layer inherits an embed-ready corpus. Iron rule reserved with it: retrieval results are evidence, never state; corpus content enters the Kernel only through a command.

## Anti-pattern checklist

| Anti-pattern | Defense in this schema |
|---|---|
| God Object | event ≠ market ≠ result — three real things, three types |
| Kitchen Sink | Bulk quotes stay in Parquet; Kernel holds pointer objects only |
| Silos | One `run`, one `market`, one `artifact` — `kind` discriminates, links extend |
| Action Sprawl | One action per state transition; no per-sport action variants |
| Golden Hammer | Odds/results arrive via ingestion Runs (pipeline), not hand-edit actions |
| Misnomer | Every name is the domain word a bettor/researcher would say; all described |

## Future extensions (reserved, deliberately unbuilt)

- **RL strategy discovery (PufferLib):** gym = `execution_environment` kind `rl_gym`; training = `run` kind `rl_training`; a learned policy = a `strategy` version whose `spec_ref` artifact is a checkpoint; rewards built from `evaluation` metrics. Every noun RL needs already exists — the extension is new `kind` values, zero new object types. Parked until the defining workflow runs end to end.
- **Research corpus / recall layer ("L5.5"):** arXiv papers live as `hypothesis.sources` citations for now; a future retrieval layer (distill-then-embed, FTS5 + sqlite-vec hybrid) treats retrieval results as **evidence, never state** — nothing becomes authoritative without passing through a Kernel command.
